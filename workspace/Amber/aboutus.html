			<p>	 We are a small company that embraces our responsibility to co-create a world 
				where each of us, our communities and our planet can flourish, be healthy and 
				look good while doing it. <br>
				<br>
				By buying locally organic food and humanely made clothing 
				we hope for a sustainable future.  This means our children and grandchildren will 
				be living in a world that values human creativity, diversity, and individual choice.<br>
				<br>
				Our focus is on food and products for children because healthy habits need to start at a very young age.

			<div class="AboutFarms">About our food source</div>
			<a href="http://barrington-natural-farms.com/"><img src="AboutUsTractor.gif"></a>
			<p>We looked for a reliable source of food raised or grown without the use of persistent pesticides.
				We are aware ofthe effects of pesticides and fertilizers on our soil and waterways.  <br>
				<br>
				Do you agree 
				that local, sustainably grown food can actually strengthen our communities? Then organic farming 
				which is a method of agriculture that pays proper respect to our health, the environment and the 
				important role of food within society</p>

			<div class="AboutClothes">About our clothing</div>
			<a href="http://www.themadeinamericamovement.com/economy/the-economic-impact-of-made-in-usa/"><img src="AboutUsBabiesClothes.gif"></a>
			<p>We strive to find apparel and accessories are made of only all natural fibers, including organic cotton, 
			   organic alpaca, wool, silk, and other fibers created by nature.  Conventional cotton is one of the most
			    pesticide-dependent crops.  Organic cotton and natural coloring can be used to produce beautiful fashion 
			    that is free of all pesticides. <br>
			    <br>		    
			   Our commitment to find products of all natural fibers and low-impact dyes stems from the desire to ensure 
			    clothing manufacturing process is environmentally friendly, and never harms water tables and local communities.
